# Fundamental Testing Practice

This repository is created to practice and revisit fundamental testing problems. Over time, it is easy to focus heavily on tools, frameworks, and automation, and slowly lose touch with basic test thinking and logic.

The goal of this repository is to get back to the basics.

## What this repository is about

This repository focuses on practicing core testing fundamentals such as:

- Understanding a problem from a testing perspective  
- Logic based testing problems  
- Basic test thinking and reasoning  
- Simple test planning approaches  

This repository is not focused on automation frameworks, tools, or advanced setups. The emphasis is on thinking, not implementation.

## Who this repository is for

This repository can be useful for:

- Testers who want to strengthen their fundamentals  
- Beginners who want to practice basic testing problems  
- Experienced testers who want to revisit core concepts  
- Anyone who wants to improve testing logic beyond tools  

## Why this repository exists

While learning tools like Playwright, I realized that I had not revisited fundamental testing problems in a long time. This repository is a personal effort to revise those basics and practice test thinking regularly.

In an AI driven world where code can be generated easily, logic and problem understanding remain important strengths for testers.

## How to use this repository

- Pick a problem and think through it before looking at any solution  
- Write down your understanding and testing approach  
- Focus on reasoning rather than finding a single correct answer  
- Use it as practice material, not as a checklist
